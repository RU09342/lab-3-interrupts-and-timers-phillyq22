 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR231x Demo - Timer1_B3, Toggle P1.0, CCR0 UP Mode ISR, 32KHz ACLK
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software and TB1_0 ISR. Timer1_B is
//  configured for UP mode, thus the timer overflows when TBR counts
//  to CCR0.
//
//  ACLK = TBCLK = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK  = default DCO = ~1MHz
